Replicated Ship is an open source application that enables easier operation of third-party applications. Ship enables three workflows: init, watch and update. These three modes of ship can be used in any existing workflow, automation or CI/CD process to install, configure and update third party applications running in Kubernetes. Ship does not deploy applications; rather ship is a utility that prepares an application or an update to be deployed using existing tools.

To install ship, follow the instuctions on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/replicatedhq/ship)

To learn about the three modes of ship and how to build Ship into a workflow to keep third -party applications updated, [continue reading](../three-modes).
