Before shipping your application, there are a few terms to learn, as they are used throughout this guide.

### Application
An application (or app) is the software package you are installing onto your customer's servers. It isn't a single binary, rather it's all of the individual components which make your product.

### Channel
Channels are used to stage out releases for customers or customer segments. By default there are Stable, Beta and Unstable channels.

### Release
A release is a shipped version of the application, complete with release notes & version number.

### Admin Console
The Admin Console is the on-prem UI that is used to install, license, configure and update an application delivered by Replicated.
