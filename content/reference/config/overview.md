Ship includes a powerful mechanism for collecting high-level configuration from cluster operators and other application end-users. At its core, ship configuration encompasses two pieces:

- A YAML syntax for defining rich, interactive forms for collecting end-user input
- A powerful template engine for injecting user-supplied configuration into your application manifests


The Ship Config documentation covers the YAML form builder in depth. For examples of using templating in your application manifests, see [Assets](/reference/assets/overview), especially [Inline Assets](/reference/assets/inline).
