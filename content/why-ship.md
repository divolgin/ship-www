# Why Ship

Replicated Ship was built to take the best practices of modern software deployment and apply them to managing third party applications.

A well designed software deployment process is designed with the *possibility* of continuous delivery. Once everything is automated, then the operator can choose to automate the deployment process and be hands-off.

Traditional on-prem software is hard to install and configure, and creates snowflake environments that are tedious to manage and operate. The overhead of managing third party software today results in the decision to use multi-tenant, hosted versions of many sensitive applications.

Applications packaged with Replicated Ship are easy to configure, install and operate using automation and customized workflows that can be tailored to work in any environment, including airgapped networks.
